# Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection
• Created an Image Detection Model to spot Banana and Cotton Plant Diseases with overall 94% accuracy.
• Used a dataset of 3246 images for both banana and cotton crops to train the model. Employed Convolutional Neural Network for precise disease prediction.
• This model provides farmers with a reliable tool to quickly identify diseases in banana and cotton plants, helping to prevent crop damage. Deployed in the System Design Lab for Agricultural Research and Development.
